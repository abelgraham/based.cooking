## Pretzel Wash (Caustic Bath)

### Important Notes

- **Always add acid to water, never water to acid.**
- Use only safe materials: **glass, stainless steel, or safe plastics.**
- Line aluminum trays with parchment paper to avoid reaction.

### Wash Preparation and Use

#### This is a preparation for pretzel bread bites, shape as you will.

1. Add 3–4 volumetric ounces of caustic acid to 4–5 cups of **cold** water.
2. Roll the dough into ropes about 1 inch in diameter. 
3. Cut into ∼½ inch portions using a joint knife.
4. Wash pieces in the caustic solution for 20 seconds.
5. Strain and place on the lined sheet tray for baking.

## Baking

1. Place on a safe surface in a convection oven until brown — about **8 minutes at 450°F**.
2. Rotate trays halfway through for even color and texture.
3. Remove from oven and immediately **brush with melted butter**.
